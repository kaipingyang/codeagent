# Changelog

## codeagent 0.1.0

First public release. `codeagent` is an R-native reimplementation of a
command-line coding agent, built on `ellmer` and `btw`. It provides the
agent harness (loop, tools, permissions, compaction, hooks, skills) plus
a CLI REPL and a `shiny` user interface.

### Model tier env var rename — breaking changes

Three environment variables have been renamed to remove vendor-specific
names. Update your `.Renviron` / `settings.json` env block accordingly:

| Old | New | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| `CODEAGENT_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | `CODEAGENT_MODEL` | Everyday main model |
| `CODEAGENT_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | `CODEAGENT_HEAVY_MODEL` | High-capability model |
| `CODEAGENT_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` | `CODEAGENT_FAST_MODEL` | Cheap/fast model |

Tier aliases used in `/model` and `codeagent.md` also changed:
`"sonnet"` → `"main"`, `"opus"` → `"heavy"`, `"haiku"` → `"fast"`.

`CODEAGENT_MODEL` now serves dual purpose: it sets both the default
model and the `"main"` tier alias (previously `CODEAGENT_MODEL` and
`CODEAGENT_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` were separate; they are now merged).

### CLI/ink unified entry point — breaking changes (plan [\#20](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/issues/20))

- **Default permission mode is now `"default"`** across all entry points
  (CLI, Shiny, ink). Previously all CLI subcommands defaulted to
  `"bypass"`. Write operations (file edits, shell commands) now prompt
  for approval unless you explicitly opt into bypass mode.

- **`-y` / `--yolo`** — new global flag for the CLI that enables bypass
  mode (skips all permission prompts). Equivalent to Claude Code’s
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Short-hand: `-y`.

      codeagent -y           # bypass REPL
      codeagent app -y       # bypass Shiny app
      codeagent run "q" -y   # bypass one-shot query

- **`codeagent` without a subcommand** now starts the interactive REPL
  directly (equivalent to `codeagent chat`). Previously a subcommand was
  required.

- **`-p` / `--print-mode`** — new flag for one-shot non-interactive
  output. `codeagent "query"` or `codeagent -p "query"` runs a single
  query and exits.

- **`-m` now means `--model`** (breaking). The old `-m`/`--mode` alias
  has been removed. Use `-y`/`--yolo` for bypass mode instead.

- **`ink_ui()` gains `yolo = FALSE`** parameter. When `TRUE`, sets
  `INK_YOLO=1` so the codeagent backend runs in bypass mode. The `inkai`
  terminal command also accepts `-y`/`--yolo`.

      ink_ui("codeagent", yolo = TRUE)   # bypass
      # or from terminal:
      inkai codeagent -y                 # bypass

- **`INK_YOLO` env var** — set to `"1"` to enable bypass mode in ink
  when launching the `inkai` command directly:
  `INK_YOLO=1 inkai codeagent`.

- **`codeagent_app(permission_mode = "default")` unchanged** — Shiny was
  already correct; pass `permission_mode = "bypass"` explicitly when
  needed.

- **`R/cli_dispatch.R`** — new internal helpers
  [`.ca_resolve_mode()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/dot-ca_resolve_mode.md)
  and
  [`.ca_dispatch()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/dot-ca_dispatch.md)
  expose CLI dispatch logic as testable pure functions.

#### Migration guide

| Old | New |
|----|----|
| `codeagent chat` | `codeagent` |
| `codeagent chat -m bypass` | `codeagent -y` |
| `codeagent -m bypass` | `codeagent -y` |
| `ink_ui("codeagent")` (was bypass) | `ink_ui("codeagent", yolo = TRUE)` for bypass |
| `inkai codeagent` (was bypass) | `inkai codeagent -y` for bypass |

### Unified agent streaming API (plan [\#19](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/issues/19))

- **[`codeagent_stream_async()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_stream_async.md)**
  — new exported function. Streams one agent turn asynchronously
  ([`coro::async`](https://coro.r-lib.org/reference/async.html)
  promise). Runs the full turn pipeline (compaction, system-reminder
  injection, session save, cost tracking via
  `get_cost(include="last")`). Fires typed callbacks: `on_delta`,
  `on_thinking`, `on_tool_request` (pre-gate, from stream chunk),
  `on_tool_result` (with typed `display` contract from
  [`.adapt_tool_result()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/dot-adapt_tool_result.md)),
  `on_error`, `on_usage`. Supports `stream_controller` for cancellation
  and `tool_mode` for concurrent tool execution.

- **[`codeagent_stream()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_stream.md)**
  — synchronous wrapper around
  [`codeagent_stream_async()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_stream_async.md)
  using
  [`later::run_now()`](https://later.r-lib.org/reference/run_now.html)
  to pump the event loop. Handles Ctrl+C gracefully (cancels the stream
  via `stream_controller`, does not re-throw the interrupt condition).
  Intended for CLI and ink frontends.

- **Turn pipeline helpers** (`R/turn_pipeline.R`, internal):
  [`.turn_setup()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/dot-turn_setup.md)
  consolidates compaction + resource replacement + system-reminder
  injection into one call.
  [`.turn_teardown()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/dot-turn_teardown.md)
  consolidates session save + usage + `cost_last`. Both are now shared
  by console, Shiny, and ink.

- **Shiny system-reminder injection fixed.** `server_chat.R`’s
  `stream_task` now injects the `<system-reminder>` block
  (date/iteration/cwd/memory) on every turn, matching the behaviour of
  the console REPL and
  [`agent_loop()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/agent_loop.md).

- **Console Ctrl+C repair.**
  [`codeagent_console()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_console.md)
  now creates a `stream_controller` per turn and catches `interrupt`
  conditions, cancelling the stream gracefully. Previously Ctrl+C could
  corrupt the chat state.

- **Callback deduplication.** `.register_repl_tool_callbacks()` is now
  guarded by `.chat_once()` to prevent stacking display callbacks if
  [`codeagent_console()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_console.md)
  is called more than once on the same chat object.

- **`.patch_interrupted_chat()` retired.** Removed from all call sites.
  ellmer 0.4.0+
  ([\#840](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/issues/840)) and
  0.4.1+ ([\#643](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/issues/643))
  handle orphaned tool requests and `AssistantPartialTurn`
  automatically.

- **`inkAssistantUI` tool cards upgraded.** `ink_reply_stream()` now
  calls
  [`codeagent_stream()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_stream.md)
  when available (full turn pipeline + display contract).
  `on_tool_result` receives a rich `display` field (title/kind/payload)
  instead of a plain string. The `ink_server()` initialises per-session
  `CompactionController` / `ContentReplacementState` / `session_id` so
  turns are properly managed.

### Multi-agent teams (post-0.1.0 additions)

- **Task DAG.**
  [`team_coordinate()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/team_coordinate.md)
  gains `blocked_by` — task dependencies given by 1-based index. A task
  is only claimed once all its blockers are `done`, so workers respect
  ordering while still parallelising independent tasks. Cyclic graphs
  are rejected up front. The shared board’s claim is now
  dependency-aware and atomic (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`).
- **Worktree isolation + crash recovery.** `worktree = TRUE` runs each
  worker in its own git worktree;
  [`board_reclaim_stale()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/board_reclaim_stale.md)
  (wired into the worker loop) resets a crashed worker’s timed-out task
  back to pending so its dependents are never blocked forever.
- **Event-driven board.**
  [`board_watch()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/board_watch.md)
  (built on the `watcher` package) reacts to board changes without
  polling, powering an event-driven coordinator / live board view (falls
  back to polling when watcher is unavailable).
- **LLM-lead coordinator.** `team_lead(goal, max_rounds =)` faithfully
  ports Claude Code’s COORDINATOR_MODE: a lead model decomposes the goal
  into a task DAG, the work-stealing team runs it, then the lead reviews
  results and either finishes or adds a follow-up round (bounded loop;
  decompose/review/coordinate steps are injectable for testing).
- **Live dashboard.** `team_dashboard(db_path)` is a standalone Shiny
  app that monitors a running team’s board in real time — task table
  (coloured by status), a progress bar, and the inter-agent message log.

### Shiny app UX (post-0.1.0 additions)

- **Instant startup.** The UI shell now renders immediately; the slower
  tool + skill registration runs in the background behind a prominent
  “Initializing codeagent…” overlay, with the chat input gated until it
  completes. Pass a bare
  [`ellmer::Chat`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/Chat.html) to
  [`codeagent_app()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_app.md)
  for this lazy path.

- **Skill metadata disk cache.**
  [`list_skills_meta()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/list_skills_meta.md)
  now caches parsed skill metadata on disk (`<config>/cache/skills/`,
  keyed by cwd + a `SKILL.md` mtime/count signature), so the slash
  typeahead and skill tool are near-instant on every launch after the
  first (a disk hit skips the ~20s directory scan). The cache
  self-invalidates when any `SKILL.md` changes or a skill is
  added/removed.

- **Single-file viewer.** Clicking a file in the Files tree now opens it
  in one static, scrollable “File” tab (code / Markdown / image / CSV)
  with a filename header and close button, replacing the old per-file
  tabs that could overflow and cover the tab strip.

### Security & testing improvements (post-0.1.0 additions)

- **keyring integration** (`R/keyring.R`): Optional API key storage via
  the OS credential store (`keyring` package). `setup.R` offers the
  keyring as an alternative to `~/.Renviron` when the backend is
  available. Includes
  [`.keyring_available()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/dot-keyring_available.md)
  (session-cached probe),
  [`.keyring_store_key()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/dot-keyring_store_key.md)
  with graceful fallback to `~/.Renviron`, and
  [`.keyring_get_key()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/dot-keyring_get_key.md).
  On headless/server environments the keyring backend probe returns
  `FALSE` and all functions degrade silently to the existing
  `~/.Renviron` path.

- **webfakes agent integration tests**
  (`tests/testthat/test-webfakes-agent.R`): 12 tests that mock the LLM
  API endpoint with `webfakes`, exercising the full agent loop — tool
  dispatch (Read, Write, Bash), permission gate (bypass vs plan), error
  recovery (HTTP 500), and skill invocation — without hitting a real
  LLM.

- **Explicit tool names**:
  [`bash_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/bash_tool.md),
  [`read_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/read_tool.md),
  [`write_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/write_tool.md),
  [`edit_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/edit_tool.md),
  [`multi_edit_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/multi_edit_tool.md),
  [`glob_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/glob_tool.md),
  [`grep_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/grep_tool.md),
  [`ls_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/ls_tool.md)
  now pass `name=` to
  [`ellmer::tool()`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/tool.html)
  so the model can refer to tools by their canonical names (Bash, Read,
  Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep, LS).

### Agent harness

- Agentic loop
  ([`agent_loop()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/agent_loop.md))
  with max-turns, token budget, verification, and error recovery
  (prompt-too-long, rate-limit, network, and auth handling).
- Seven-mode permission system: `default`, `plan`, `accept_edits`,
  `bypass`, `dont_ask`, `auto`, and `bubble` (sub-agent decisions bubble
  to the parent). Fine-grained rules match on tool arguments
  (e.g. `Bash(npm run test *)`).
- Twelve-event hook system covering tool, permission, message, and
  lifecycle events, configurable declaratively from `settings.json`.
- Five-level context compaction (snip, session memory, full summary,
  prompt fallback, context collapse).
- System prompt with tone, task, convention, tool-use, and R-specific
  guidance.

### Tools

- Core tools: `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Glob`,
  `Grep`, `LS`.
- `RunR` executes R code behind the permission gate; with sandboxing
  enabled it runs in an isolated `callr` subprocess with a scrubbed
  environment (secrets hidden), no `.Renviron` reload, and a wall-clock
  timeout.
- `btw` tool groups (docs, git, pkg, env, etc.), web fetch and search,
  notebook tools, task and persistent-todo tools.
- Optional codebase retrieval via `ragnar` (vector + keyword search).

### Coordination

- Sub-agents via
  [`agent_tool()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/agent_tool.md),
  with optional git-worktree isolation and persistent “sidechain”
  sessions.
- Parallel teams:
  [`team_run()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/team_run.md)
  (fixed fan-out) and
  [`team_coordinate()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/team_coordinate.md)
  (work-stealing over a shared SQLite board with inter-agent messaging),
  both capped to the container’s CPU quota via `parallelly`.
- Plan-mode tools let the model enter and exit read-only planning
  mid-turn.

### State and configuration

- Sessions saved as JSONL with lossless tool-call preservation; fork,
  rename, tag, resume, and rewind
  ([`truncate_chat_turns()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/truncate_chat_turns.md)
  / `/rewind`).
- Auto-memory persisted across sessions, with relevance selection by a
  small fast model.
- `settings.json` configuration mirroring command-line agents: `env`
  block, model tiers, permissions, hooks, MCP servers, sandbox, effort
  level, and more.
- Model switching mid-conversation
  ([`switch_model()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/switch_model.md)),
  lossless where possible.

### Interfaces

- CLI: `codeagent` executable with `run`, `chat`/`repl`, `app`,
  `skills`, `mcp`, and `info` sub-commands; the REPL streams output,
  shows tool activity, and renders reasoning blocks.
- `shiny` app
  ([`codeagent_app()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_app.md))
  with tool cards, session management, and theme options.
- MCP server
  ([`codeagent_mcp_server()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/codeagent_mcp_server.md),
  stdio and HTTP) and MCP client
  ([`register_mcp_client()`](https://github.com/kaipingyang/codeagent/reference/register_mcp_client.md),
  stdio) for external tool interoperability.
